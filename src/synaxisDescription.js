## System Overview

Synaxis is a workflow orchestration and claim management system. It integrates various components and processes, focusing on the lifecycle of claims and work items within an enterprise context.

### Core Components

#### Claims Management
- **Claim Representation**: Each claim is a distinct entity in the system, encapsulated with relevant details including claimant credentials and claim specifics.
- **Verification Process**: Claims undergo a structured verification process, ensuring accuracy and integrity of data.

#### Work Items
- **Lifecycle Stages**: Each claim is treated as a work item, progressing through predefined stages: 'notStarted', 'inProgress', and 'completed'.
- **State Management**: The system tracks and updates the state of each work item, reflecting its current stage in the workflow process.

### Workflow Management

- **Work Item Generation**: On claim creation, a new work item is either automatically generated or linked to an existing one, based on provided input.
- **Retrieval and Tracking**: The system supports retrieval of work items by their current state and allows updates to their status, facilitating efficient workflow management.
- **Data Integrity**: Emphasizes maintaining data integrity and referential consistency, especially when work items are referenced or linked to claims.

### Technical Highlights

- **Automated Work Item Creation**: Automatically initiates a new work item when a claim is created without an existing work item link.
- **Progress Tracking**: Enables real-time tracking and updating of work item statuses.
- **Referential Integrity**: Ensures consistency and integrity by verifying the existence of referenced work items.

### System Usage

- **Creating a Claim**: Initiates a claim along with an associated work item. If no \`workflowId\` is provided, a new work item is created.
- **Updating Work Items**: Provides functionality to update the status of a work item through its lifecycle.
- **Querying Work Items**: Supports fetching work items based on their status, e.g., the next unstarted or the most recently created item.
